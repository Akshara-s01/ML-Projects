# OLX Car Price Prediction System

**Project Overview:**

The OLX Car Price Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to estimate the selling price of used cars listed on OLX. The system leverages various car features such as make, model, year, kilometers driven, and fuel type to provide an accurate price prediction.


**Key Features:**

* Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical data using label encoding and performed data cleaning techniques to prepare the dataset.
* Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared multiple models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), with the Decision Tree algorithm selected as the best model for the web application.
* User Interface: Developed a user-friendly interface where users input car details to receive an estimated price using the Decision Tree model.
* Real-World Dataset: Worked with a dataset of over 9,000 car listings with features like car name, model, year, fuel type, and more to deliver realistic price estimates.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python: For data manipulation and machine learning.
* Machine Learning: Focus on Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN algorithms.
* Google Colab: For model training and experimentation.
* Streamlit: For building an interactive web application in Visual Studio Code.


**How It Works:**

* Input: Users provide car information such as make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, etc.
* Prediction: The Decision Tree model processes the input and provides a predicted price.
* Output: The web interface displays the predicted car price based on the model.

**Conclusion:**
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict car prices, aiding users in estimating the value of used cars on OLX.
